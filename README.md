# 4 Agent Start
Mod for Invisible Inc. that allows starting with 4, or with 6, or with **up to 16 agents**. Requires Sim Constructor.

The agent selection screen will be presented multiple times, allowing you to select more pairs of agents.

Note: if you try to select the same agent twice or more, only the last instance will be added to the party, therefore it is possible to start with an odd number of agents as well.
